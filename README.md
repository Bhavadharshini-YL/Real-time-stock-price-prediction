# Real-time-stock-price-prediction

## Introduction
Predicting stock market movements has always been one of the most challenging tasks in data science. With constantly changing market trends and highly volatile price behavior, traditional models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies. Built from scratch with clean data preprocessing, model engineering, and detailed visualizations, this project serves as an excellent real-world example of applying machine learning to financial forecasting. Whether you're learning deep learning, building your portfolio, or exploring financial analytics, this project gives a strong foundation in time-series modeling and real-time prediction systems.
